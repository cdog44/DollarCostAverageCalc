# DollarCostAverageCalc
Calculates the amount of shares that one would need to purchase to lower average cost/share of a stock to a selected dollar average.

Progam would accept the following entries:
CurrentAvgCost = Current cost/share average of XYZ stock.
CurrentSharePrice = Price at which stock XYZ is currently trading
NewAvgPrice = Desired price that you want your XYZ shares cost to average out to after purchase.

Program would return the following:
BuyShares = The amount of shares that you would need to purchase at the current price to bring your new dollar cost average down to the desired price.

Example: I own 10 shares of XYZ at $10/share. The price of XYZ is currently trading at $5. I want to average down my cost/share on XYZ to be $7.50/share. The program would then return that I would need to purchase 10 shares at $5 to bring my cost/share average down to $7.50.
